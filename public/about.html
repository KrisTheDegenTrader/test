<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>
  I'm Kris, a proud degenerate crypto trader whoâ€™s been in the game since 2012â€”back when Bitcoin was the price of a cup of coffee. My average rate of return is a casual 800% every 4 years, which sounds impressive until you realize I also buy tops like itâ€™s my hobby.

<p>
  Iâ€™ve been successful enough to  put a down payment on a houseâ€¦ but who needs real estate when youâ€™re always one moonshot away from retiring on a private island? Whether itâ€™s hunting the next 100x coin or holding through a dip that looks suspiciously like a crash, Iâ€™m here for the chaos and the gains. ðŸš€
