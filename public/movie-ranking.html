<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</h3>
<p>The story of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who turns Wall Street into his personal playground. Armed with a phone, a questionable moral compass, and an unlimited supply of Quaaludes, Jordan builds a shady empire, turning penny stocks into millions. Along the way, there are yachts, helicopters, dwarves, and enough partying to make Vegas blush.

It’s a wild ride through greed, excess, and utter chaos, proving that while crime doesn’t pay in the end, it sure throws one hell of a party along the way.</p>
<h3>The Big Short (2015)</h3>
<p>is what happens when a few eccentric financial outsiders realize the entire housing market is built on lies, bad loans, and Jenga-level instability. Armed with spreadsheets, big bets, and plenty of sarcasm, they decide to profit off the impending collapse while the rest of Wall Street snoozes through the warning signs.

Along the way, you get celebrity cameos explaining complex financial terms, a deep dive into human greed, and a sobering reminder that when the economy crashes, regular people get wrecked while the suits cash out. It’s like a dark comedy, but with mortgages and moral dilemmas. 🏠📉🤯</p>
<h3>Wall Street (1987)</h3>
<p>is the OG tale of ambition, greed, and insider trading wrapped in power suits and suspenders. It follows Bud Fox, an eager young stockbroker who idolizes Gordon Gekko—a ruthless corporate raider with a knack for making money and ruining lives.

Bud gets seduced by the high life: fast cash, fancy apartments, and the “Greed is good” mantra. But soon, he realizes that selling your soul for a Ferrari isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. It’s a sharp lesson in ethics, ambition, and why you should never trust a guy with slicked-back hair. 💼💸🚀</p>
