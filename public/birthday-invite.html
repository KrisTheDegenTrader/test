<h3>What to bring:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>📅 When: Jan 3, 2009</li>
  <li>⏰ Time: 8:30PM at my crib</li>
  <li>📍 Where: 10750 Atlantic Blvd #12, Jacksonville, FL 32225, United States</li>
</ul>

<h3>There’ll be cake, drinks, and probably a PowerPoint on why my next trade is DEFINITELY the one to retire on. Come for the laughs, stay for the trading war stories, and leave knowing you’re still better at life than me.

P.S. BYOB (Bring Your Own Bitcoin). 🚀💸</h3>
